</p>

# Model Architecture

The model is built using the DnCNN architecture described in paper with network depth of 21

## Training Data

The model is trained on the <a href="[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenewone/cub2002011](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/berkeley-segmentation-dataset-500-bsds500)">Berkeley Segmentation Dataset 500 (BSDS500)</a> datatset available on Kaggle

## Training Results

**MSE**: Mean Squared Error

| Network Depth | Training Loss (MSE) | Validation Loss (MSE) |
| :---: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
| 21 | 0.0002 | 0.0002 |

## Denoising Results

Following are some of the results of the model on a few images with added gaussian noise from the test and validation sets of the dataset
